* Start Menu

start-menu is a little tool that will add a "Start" menu in the menu bar.

You can use the Start menu to executing external program just like the start menu in windows.

* Usage

If you are using debian linux or ubuntu linux just (require 'start-menu)

Otherwise, you should config start-menu-menu-conf first then (require 'start-menu)

For Windows user: the path to program often contains space, so may be you should use "" to quote the path
